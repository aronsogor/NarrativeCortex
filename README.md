# NarrativeCortex
Narrative Cortex is a local-first narrative simulator powered by Ollama + Mistral.
It generates dynamic story beats — not from scripts, but from relationship state, emotional tension, and emergent motivation.

Inspired by the spirit of Sid Meier’s Pirates! and the structure of AI-driven storytelling, it blends:
	•	🎭 Character-driven beats instead of static scenes
	•	🧩 Modular arcs that emerge from your actions — not prewritten plots
	•	🧠 Memory graphs tracking trust, betrayal, grief, desire
	•	✍️ LLM-powered generation to create infinite variations
	•	🚀 Fully local using Ollama + Python — no cloud required

Think: a narrative engine that remembers what you said last night…
and decides whether Jozsi forgives you today.
